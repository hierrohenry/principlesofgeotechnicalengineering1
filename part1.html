      <h2>What is Geotechnical Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Soil</i> is defined as loose aggregates of mineral grains, with liquid and gas in the empty spaces
        between the solid particles. Soil is often used to support structures in Civil and Structural Engineering.
        The <i>properties</i> of soil govern their strength and behaviour. Properties of soils include origin, grain-size
        distribution, porosity, compressibility, shear strength and load bearing capacity.
